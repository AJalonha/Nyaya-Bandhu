Smart India Hackathon Entry 2023 
Incentives based Design for onboarding Legal Service Providers such as Advocates, Arbitrators, Mediators, Notaries, Document Writers, etc on eMarket Place for extending Legal Services to Citizens in India
<br>In India, the legal service sector is largely unorganized, making it difficult for people to access legal services. Many legal service providers, such as advocates, arbitrators, mediators, notaries, and document writers, operate independently and do not have a centralized platform to offer their services to clients. This leads to a lack of transparency, difficulty in finding the right legal service provider, and high costs for clients.
The e-Marketplace platform for providing legal services should be user-friendly, secure, and transparent, and should address the following challenges:
1. How to incentivize legal service providers to offer their services on the platform?
2. How to ensure transparency and accountability in the services provided by legal service providers?
3. How to ensure the quality of legal services provided by the service providers?
4. How to ensure that clients can easily find the right legal service provider for their specific legal needs? 5. How to ensure that the platform is accessible to citizens from all socio-economic backgrounds?
